# A small educational text game prototype

A training text game prototype app on C# intended as an educational/exam app for the mentorship.

## Approximate plans for the app

This app is intended as a 4-week long educational/exam project with me as a mentor and @gitSokolAV as the mentee/developer. Some (not final by any stretch) plans include:

- 4 locations: Square, Forest, Cave, Weapon Shop.
- Square has a guard that says a random phrase.
- Cave has a monster you can fight.
- Weapon Shop has a shopkeeper that sells you weapons (duh!).
- Player starts in Forest with bare fists as a weapon. They can buy one of the three other weapons from the Shopkeeper later.
