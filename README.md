# A WPF Organizer app

A training organizer app on C#/WPF intended as an educational/exam app for the mentorship.

## Approximate plans for the app

This app is intended as a month-long educational/exam project with me as a mentor and @gitSokolAV as the mentee/developer. Some (not final by any stretch) plans include:

- A bubble + connections tree-style way of organizing information.
- Finished/unfinished state of tasks, e-mail notifications for tasks being overdue etc.
- Possible budget planner
- Possible time tracker
- Checklists for the bubbles.
